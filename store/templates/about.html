<div>
<p class="fst-normal">In our country there are many tools which can be shared by many people. But there is no particular platform to share those tools. It will be helpful as well. There is a huge amount of demand of this type of website in our country. So, we are going to make a tools sharing website.
Our main aim is to make a website by which we can share tools by rent. It is a Django based model. This model will be developed to help people who need tools in case of their requirement. Also for the people who canâ€™t afford to buy tools.</p>
